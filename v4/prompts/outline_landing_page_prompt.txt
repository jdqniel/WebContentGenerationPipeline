Your primary task is to generate a detailed outline for a "Landing Page".

This outline should map out the key sections of a high-converting landing page, including headlines, value propositions, features, social proof, and a clear call-to-action.

- "title": the primary headline for the page.
- "body": an ordered array of section titles representing landing page elements.

### CONTEXT FOR THE OUTLINE ###
- **Main Topic:** The content will be about "{partners}".
- **Specific Focus:** The focus should be on "{strategy_focus}".

2. Key Benefits or Value Propositions.
3. Feature Highlights or Use Cases.
4. Testimonials or Social Proof.
5. Pricing or Offer Details.
6. Call-to-Action / Next Steps.
