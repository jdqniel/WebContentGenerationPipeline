Your primary task is to generate a detailed outline for a "{documentType}" by selecting and using the dedicated prompt for that type.
The outline should be comprehensive enough for a long, in-depth article.
Generate a main title for the article and at least 5-7 relevant section titles that flow logically.
Your output MUST be a single, valid JSON object with two keys: "title" (a string for the main article title) and "body" (an array of strings, where each string is a section title).

### CONTEXT FOR THE OUTLINE ###
- **Main Topic:** The content will be about "{partners}".
- **Specific Focus:** The focus should be on "{strategy_focus}".
- **Target Audience:** "{target_audience}".
- **Content Goal:** "{content_goal}".

Generate the JSON outline now.

### NOTE
The generic prompt will fallback if a type-specific prompt file is not found.
