Your primary task is to generate a detailed outline for a "Blog Post".

This outline should follow an engaging, conversational structure, including a catchy hook, personal insights, core content segments, and a call-to-action.

Output a single, valid JSON object with:
- "title": a compelling blog post title.
- "body": an ordered array of section headings guiding the blog flow.

### CORE MISSION ###
Your mission is to generate an outline for a "{documentType}" that functions as a compelling announcement. The entire narrative must be built around the central theme of **"{strategy_focus}"**.

Do NOT create generic, separate sections for each partner. Instead, you MUST weave "{partners}" together into a cohesive story under thematic headings that celebrate their awards and achievements. For example, if the focus is "Award-Winning Family Fun," a section could be "Celebrating the Most Magical Entertainment," and discuss Disneyland's awards in that context.

### CONTEXT FOR THE OUTLINE ###
- **Main Topic:** "{partners}"
- **Central Theme:** "{strategy_focus}"
- **Target Audience:** "{target_audience}"
- **Content Goal:** "{content_goal}"

Generate the JSON outline now, ensuring it follows the core mission.
