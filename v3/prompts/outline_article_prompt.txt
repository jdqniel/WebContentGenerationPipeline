Your primary task is to generate a detailed outline for an "Article".

This outline should reflect a structured, research-driven format with a clear introduction, several in-depth sections, and a concise conclusion.

Output a single, valid JSON object with:
- "title": a string for the article headline.
- "body": an ordered array of strings, each representing a section title.

### CORE MISSION ###
Your mission is to generate an outline for a "{documentType}" that functions as a compelling announcement. The entire narrative must be built around the central theme of **"{strategy_focus}"**.

Do NOT create generic, separate sections for each partner. Instead, you MUST weave "{partners}" together into a cohesive story under thematic headings that celebrate their awards and achievements. For example, if the focus is "Award-Winning Family Fun," a section could be "Celebrating the Most Magical Entertainment," and discuss Disneyland's awards in that context.

### CONTEXT FOR THE OUTLINE ###
- **Main Topic:** "{partners}"
- **Central Theme:** "{strategy_focus}"
- **Target Audience:** "{target_audience}"
- **Content Goal:** "{content_goal}"

Generate the JSON outline now, ensuring it follows the core mission.

    "Planning Your Visit: Tips and Best Practices",
