## OUTPUT STRUCTURE & REQUIREMENTS ##
Your output MUST be a single, valid JSON object containing the keys: "title", "body_blocks", and "body_markdown".

### IMPORTANT RULES FOR DYNAMIC CONTENT ###
- The example below defines the FORMAT, not the LENGTH.
- Create a complete and comprehensive piece of content. The `body_blocks` array should contain as many blocks as necessary to write a full article (e.g., 400-500+ words). Be thorough.

### JSON STRUCTURE EXAMPLE ###
```json
{{
  "title": "A Compelling and Relevant Title",
  "body_blocks": [
    {{
      "type": "heading",
      "level": 2,
      "text": "First Main Section Heading"
    }},
